MATDNR Toolbox

The MATDNR Toolbox v1.0 is a Matlab-based package to solve a large-scale DNR problem about choosing optimal switch status of sectionalizing switches (normally closed) 
and tie-switches (normally open). As long as the typology is fixed, then the DNR problem becomes a large-scale optimal reactive power flow (ORPF) problem. In this vein,
we enable this MATDNR Toolbox to primarily include ORPF and DNR solvers. 

The aim of either an ORPF or DNR problem is to seek the minimum power losses of distribution networks. All of operational constraints can be formulated in linear or 
nonlinear, any of which is based on DistFlow equations. The corresponding solvers are dependent on linear programming (MILP), mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP),
quadratic programming (MIQP), second-order conic programming (SOCP), semi-definite programing (SDP) solvers provided by MOSEK, Baron, and SeduMi. Therefore, these 
commercial solvers should be installed before running this DNR Toolbox.

In this version, it is constructed with the MOSEK Aps 7.0 and Baron v. 1.89 using their LP and SOCP solvers, and SeduMi v1.1 using the SDP solver. The usage of different
optimization models via this DNR toolbox, i.e., MISOCP-based or polyhedral approximation of DNR models, can be found in the case study of previous sections. Please also 
kindly note that this Matlab programming package is issued as our initial version, after which more multi-functional version will be updated soon.
